# Spaceship-ML

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal of the challenge is to predict whether passengers aboard the interstellar spaceship Titanic were transported to another dimension after a spacetime anomaly. This project covers all stages of a typical machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and advanced model development and training.

After evaluating multiple approaches, an automated strategy using AutoGluon was adopted to efficiently explore and optimize a wide range of modeling techniques. AutoGluon is an advanced AutoML library developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that streamlines model selection, hyperparameter tuning, feature preprocessing, and ensemble creation. This approach enabled rapid experimentation while consistently delivering high-quality predictive performance.

The final model achieved over 81% accuracy, placing it in the top 2% of the Kaggle leaderboard. Potential areas for further improvement could include additional feature engineering, alternative strategies for imputing missing values, or fine-tuning AutoGluon’s parameters. However, given that the top scores on the leaderboard are around 82%, any gains are likely to be marginal.
